SUMMARY:The Lament of the Cliff-Shadowed Hollow
DTSTART:20260113T230000Z
DTEND:20260407T065900Z
UID:d8f7f9cea1e785f9c61c7e203cfda19f@hoyo-calendar
DESCRIPTION:Climb the tower that stands unbroken from the pioneering age. 
 Gaze upon the time-worn wilds — as the first Ratniki once did — and th
 e mountains that have endured the passing years.\nThe blood of bygone batt
 les remains\, and a quiet tale continues to resonate among the ruined wall
 s of the lakeside palace. As old enemies regroup beneath the dark\, leaden
  clouds\, the restless north wind carries the marching songs of war once m
 ore.\n\n
